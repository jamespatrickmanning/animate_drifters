# animate_drifters
visualize observed drifter tracks via animation using Linux "convert" utility to generate a "gif" file

Originally written by Tanya in ~2010, this routine evidently has the option to zoom-in on specified drifters.

Modified by JiM in Dec 2018 while animating 2018 Cape Cod Bay drifters.

As of this time, may require our homegrown "basemap" module but those lines are not necessary
