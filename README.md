# animate_drifters

NOTE: During the Summer of 2020,  I decided I should probably abandon this old Python 2.7 code in favor of interactive Python with time sliders.
It might still work on my office desktops but too difficult to maintain otherwise.

visualizes observed drifter tracks via animation using Linux "convert" utility to generate a "gif" file

Originally written by Tanya in ~2010, this routine evidently has the option to zoom-in on specified drifters.

Modified by JiM in Dec 2018 while animating 2018 Cape Cod Bay drifters.

Modified by Jim in July 2019 to add the "pltsst.py" option with satellite SST background

As of this time, may require our homegrown "basemap" module but those lines are not necessary
